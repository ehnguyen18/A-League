# A-League
- This is my big project for the Web subject at University. It is a replication from www.a-league.com/ladder
- The project is developed on php, with html embed in each file.
- The project was linked to a database on my Uni's server, which is no longer available.
- I'm still working on a method to host the project.
- Limited functionality demo from the "html-demo" branch: https://ehnguyen18.github.io/A-League/
